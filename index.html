                 <li><q>Man, what are you talking about? Me in chains? You may fetter my leg but my will, not even Zeus himself can overpower.</q></li>
                   <br>
                 <li><q>Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.</q></li>
                   <br>
                 <li><q>Only the educated are free.</q></li>
                   <br>
                 <li><q>No man is free who is not master of himself.</q></li>
                   <br>
                 <li><q>To accuse others for one's own misfortune is a sign of want of education. To accuse oneself shows that one's education has begun. To accuse neither oneself nor others shows that one's education is complete.</q></li>
                   <br>
                 <li><q>I laugh at those who think they can damage me. They do not know who I am, they do not know what I think, they cannot even touch the things which are really mine and with which I live.</q></li>
                   <br>
                 <li><q>Circumstances don't make the man, they only reveal him to himself.</q></li>
                   <br>
                 <li><q>Seek not the good in external things; seek it in yourselves.</q></li>
